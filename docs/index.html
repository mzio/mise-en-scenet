        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          In film analysis, a scene's <i>mise-en-scène</i> and cinematography - or anything a director can do to help
          stage a scene and how he or she shoots a shot - play a significant role in conveying a larger message beyond
          the explicit plot of a shot. These
          deliberately chosen elements such as shot depth, colors, lighting, and camera movement can go a
          long way in conveying a
          director's specific vision for a scene. While these artistic choices often play a subliminal role in
          determining how we react and why we feel a certain way in regard to watching a film, as audience members
          we can also explicitly analyze these shots to get a greater understanding of a director's intended message.
          In fact, one of the most powerful examples of how these visual elements underlie effective visual storytelling
          lies
          in its potential association with the larger aspect of a film's uniqueness and overall genre.
          Even if we do not know the exact plot of a film sequence, the frenzied, dynamic shots of an
          action clip can distinguish itself from the more slow and somber stills of a drama. Along
          another dimension, because mise-en-scène and a film's visual language can play such a large role in getting
          a director's message across, we can imagine that it might be possible to determine a scene's director just
          from the visual information contained in that scene alone. Just as authors might have
          certain writing styles that become apparent across their prose, the countless visual depictions
          that make up patterns throughout a film might be able to give away directors from their shots alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through such analysis, it could be interesting to discover the iconic elements of directors that show up
          most frequently or prominently in their work. To get at the latter, another interesting follow-up might be
          to ask, given the ability to distinguish the directors of frames and scenes by visual information alone,
          what is the most iconic 30 second shot of a two hour film? By explicitly analyzing these video clips we can
          then hope to identify a bit of what makes a certain film feel a certain way.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Why use machine learning?</h4>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, as a college student definitely growing a deeper appreciation for film but no where close
          to
          being a veteran cinephile, identifying the visual elements of single video clip is hard enough. To
          remember
          these visual elements across an entire two-hour movie, and then figure out which ones are prominent enough
          to distinguish a frame's director across a series of movies feels downright impossible. Luckily, this is
          where <b>machine learning and artificial intelligence can come to the rescue</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Briefly speaking, machine learning involves building computer algorithms that can learn to process
          data in an intelligent manner on their own. Classic examples of related work involve learning to
          distinguish pictures of cats and dogs, or identifying the right digit associated with a handwritten
          number. Although
          bad at higher level intelligence (e.g. following the plot of a movie from start to finish), these
          algorithms
          can excel in cases where they are strictly told to learn one thing and have large amount of data to
          recognize patterns in. Because they can do all of this in an automated manner, this gives us a basis for
          comparing a multitude of scenes both within and across different films.
        </p>
        <p>
          Accordingly, using thirteen of the films screened in class, I first teach a machine learning
          model to automatically identify a frame's director from the visual information or mise-en-scène alone.
          Given these films, the model essentially pores over hundreds of shorter video clips sampled from the
          larger movies, and slowly learns associations between the visual information present in the clip and the
          fact that the clip was shot by a certain director. We can then identify the most "iconic" scenes by
          looking
          at the most recognizable scenes associated with each director according to the model. While as humans we
          adopt certain
          language to formalize and define these artistic visual choices, the model learns these
          associations without knowledge of the definitions or connotations of elements such as lighting, color,
          or shot type. Based on what the model has discovered from the ground-up using the visual pixel information
          of the video frames, we then supplement these discoveries with our own interpretation of mise-en-scène.

        <h3>Learning associations with mise-en-scène</h3>
        <p>
          As mentioned earlier, mise-en-scène can refer to <i>anything</i> that a director does to stage a scene and
          capture a certain type of shot on camera. In this work, we focus however on the elements of mise-en-scène
          capable of being captured from a single frame. As an example, we can take a look specifically at how
          <i>lighting</i> and <i>color</i> play a role in setting up a shot.

        <p>
          As an example, in the above shot from Zhang Yimou's <i>To Live</i>, we can immediately note the natural
          lighting and dusty brown color, courtesy of the environment Fugui finds himself in with regard to the gambling
          den. This natural lighting and overarching but rather drab color scheme shows up in several additional shots,
          where even colors that are distinctly supposed to be brighter seem to be muddled by natural shading and an
          overarching brown. The lack of bright colors conveys a certain grunginess that comes not only with hardship
          but especially one faced in an ordinary setting, where the difficulties of life have become the norm.

          In contrast, Wong Kar-wai's <i>Chungking Express</i> trades this color monotony for
          pops of color. The lighting is still natural, but the exposure especially in the second half of the film
          seems much more turned up. We can see the distinct blue and yellow of the second policeman and
          Faye's shirts, along with various contrasting shades in the background. While the natural lighting gives some
          indication that their lives are also ordinary, through the color there is a dream-like surrealism that goes
          along with both the dramatic moody first half and more light-hearted second part of <i>Chungking Express</i>.

        <h3>Teaching our machine learning model</h3>
        <p>
          We just looked at two movies and found visual differences in mise-en-scène that could help us distinguish them
          from each other. However, now we'd like to see if a machine learning model can learn these visual distinctions
          as well. Doing so, we can identify the most iconic video clips across many more films according to our model,
          which might help us characterize the elements of mise-en-scène that define the films and their directors.
        </p>
        <p>
          To remind ourselves, we want to figure out if we can identify the director of a frame just from the visual
          information in that frame alone. We call this task <i>classification</i>, as we're essentially trying to
          determine for each movie frame which class (i.e. the director) a specific frame belongs to. Once we have this,
          we can try to find the frames that the model has the easiest time classifying, and further look at the
          mise-en-scène apparent in each of these.
        </p>
        <h4>Dataset and film setup</h4>
        <p>
          In order to teach our model, we have to essentially curate a large amount of video data. Each data point can
          be thought of as an individual video frame sampled from its film, as well as a label that in our case denotes
          the director behind that film. Our model learns by being given a frame, making a prediction for a director by
          choosing among all possible directors, and then changing its own internal parameters a bit to correct
          itself if it was wrong. We call this entire process <i>training</i> the model.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this analysis, we wanted our model to be able to classify the right director for frames from the following
          films:

          To organize these movies into a video dataset, I first downloaded each movie and split it as evenly as
          possible
          into two-minute video clips (the graph above showing the distribution of such clips). Our machine learning
          model only takes images as input, so for each video clip I
          additionally sampled a single video frame uniformly across the clip every five seconds. This lead to a total
          of 9096 video clips to work with.

        <h3>Visualizing our model results</h3>
        <p>
          Because this is a film studies class, the details for actually training our model are out of scope. However,
          for those interested the code is availble at <a
            href="https://github.com/mzio/mise-en-scenet">https://github.com/mzio/mise-en-scenet</a>. However, we can
          still give some indication that our model was able to classify our frames correctly. To determine whether a
          certain frame was directed by someone or another, the model essentially
          learns to represent each frame in a specific manner, where ideally frames shot by the same director end up
          closer to each other or in clusters.
