        <h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          In film analysis, a scene's <i>mise-en-scène</i> and cinematography - or anything a director can do to help
          stage a scene and how he or she shoots a shot - play a significant role in conveying a larger message beyond
          the explicit plot of a shot. These
          deliberately chosen elements such as shot depth, colors, lighting, and camera movement can go a
          long way in conveying a
          director's specific vision for a scene. While these artistic choices often play a subliminal role in
          determining how we react and why we feel a certain way in regard to watching a film, as audience members
          we can also explicitly analyze these shots to get a greater understanding of a director's intended message.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, one of the most powerful examples of how these visual elements underlie effective visual storytelling
          lies
          in its potential association with the larger aspect of a film's uniqueness and overall genre.
          Even if we do not know the exact plot of a film sequence, the frenzied, dynamic shots of an
          action clip can distinguish itself from the more slow and somber stills of a drama. Along
          another dimension, because mise-en-scène and a film's visual language can play such a large role in getting
          a director's message across, we can imagine that it might be possible to determine a scene's director just
          from the visual information contained in that scene alone. Just as authors might have
          certain writing styles that become apparent across their prose, the countless visual depictions
          that make up patterns throughout a film might be able to give away directors from their shots alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through such analysis, it could be interesting to discover the iconic elements of directors that show up
          most frequently or prominently in their work. To get at the latter, another interesting follow-up might be
          to ask, given the ability to distinguish the directors of frames and scenes by visual information alone,
          what is the most iconic 30 second shot of a two hour film? By explicitly analyzing these video clips we can
          then hope to identify a bit of what makes a certain film feel a certain way.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Why use machine learning?</h4>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, as a college student definitely growing a deeper appreciation for film but no where close
          to
          being a veteran cinephile, identifying the visual elements of single video clip is hard enough. To
          remember
          these visual elements across an entire two-hour movie, and then figure out which ones are prominent enough
          to distinguish a frame's director across a series of movies feels downright impossible. Luckily, this is
          where <b>machine learning and artificial intelligence can come to the rescue</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Briefly speaking, machine learning involves building computer algorithms that can learn to process
          data in an intelligent manner on their own. Classic examples of related work involve learning to
          distinguish pictures of cats and dogs, or identifying the right digit associated with a handwritten
          number. Although
          bad at higher level intelligence (e.g. following the plot of a movie from start to finish), these
          algorithms
          can excel in cases where they are strictly told to learn one thing and have large amount of data to
          recognize patterns in. Because they can do all of this in an automated manner, this gives us a basis for
          comparing a multitude of scenes both within and across different films.
        </p>
        <p>
          Accordingly, using thirteen of the films screened in class, I first teach a machine learning
          model to automatically identify a frame's director from the visual information or mise-en-scène alone.
          Given these films, the model essentially pores over hundreds of shorter video clips sampled from the
          larger movies, and slowly learns associations between the visual information present in the clip and the
          fact that the clip was shot by a certain director. We can then identify the most "iconic" scenes by
          looking
          at the most recognizable scenes associated with each director according to the model. While as humans we
          adopt certain
          language to formalize and define these artistic visual choices, the model learns these
          associations without knowledge of the definitions or connotations of elements such as lighting, color,
          or shot type. Based on what the model has discovered from the ground-up using the visual pixel information
          of the video frames, we then supplement these discoveries with our own interpretation of mise-en-scène.

        <h3>Learning associations with mise-en-scène</h3>
        <p>
          As mentioned earlier, mise-en-scène can refer to <i>anything</i> that a director does to stage a scene and
          capture a certain type of shot on camera. In this work, we focus however on the elements of mise-en-scène
          capable of being captured from a single frame. As an example, we can take a look specifically at how
          <i>lighting</i> and <i>color</i> play a role in setting up a shot.

          As an example, in the above shot from Zhang Yimou's <i>To Live</i>, we can immediately note the natural
          lighting and dusty brown color, courtesy of the environment Fugui finds himself in with regard to the gambling
          den. This natural lighting and overarching but rather drab color scheme shows up in several additional shots,
          where even colors that are distinctly supposed to be brighter seem to be muddled by natural shading and an
          overarching brown. The lack of bright colors conveys a certain grunginess that comes not only with hardship
          but especially one faced in an ordinary setting, where the difficulties of life have become the norm.

          In contrast, Wong Kar-wai's <i>Chungking Express</i> trades this color monotony for
          pops of color. The lighting is still natural, but the exposure especially in the second half of the film
          seems much more turned up. We can see the distinct blue and yellow of the second policeman and
          Faye's shirts, along with various contrasting shades in the background. While the natural lighting gives some
          indication that their lives are also ordinary, through the color there is a dream-like surrealism that goes
          along with both the dramatic moody first half and more light-hearted second part of <i>Chungking Express</i>.

        <h3>Teaching our machine learning model</h3>
        <p>
          We just looked at two movies and found visual differences in mise-en-scène that could help us distinguish them
          from each other. However, now we'd like to see if a machine learning model can learn these visual distinctions
          as well. Doing so, we can identify the most iconic video clips across many more films according to our model,
          which might help us characterize the elements of mise-en-scène that define the films and their directors.
        </p>
        <p>
          To remind ourselves, we want to figure out if we can identify the director of a frame just from the visual
          information in that frame alone. We call this task <i>classification</i>, as we're essentially trying to
          determine for each movie frame which class (i.e. the director) a specific frame belongs to. Once we have this,
          we can try to find the frames that the model has the easiest time classifying, and further look at the
          mise-en-scène apparent in each of these.
        </p>
        <h4>Dataset and film setup</h4>
        <p>
          In order to teach our model, we have to essentially curate a large amount of video data. Each data point can
          be thought of as an individual video frame sampled from its film, as well as a label that in our case denotes
          the director behind that film. Our model learns by being given a frame, making a prediction for a director by
          choosing among all possible directors, and then changing its own internal parameters a bit to correct
          itself if it was wrong. We call this entire process <i>training</i> the model.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this analysis, we wanted our model to be able to classify the right director for frames from the following
          films:

          To organize these movies into a video dataset, I first downloaded each movie and split it as evenly as
          possible
          into two-minute video clips (the graph above showing the distribution of such clips). Our machine learning
          model only takes images as input, so for each video clip I
          additionally sampled a single video frame uniformly across the clip every five seconds. This lead to a total
          of 8896 video clips to work with.

        <h3>Visualizing our model results</h3>
        <p>
          After training on one part of the data, our model was able to classify 72% of all frames on the other part.
          Because this is a
          film studies class, the details for actually training our model are out of scope. However,
          for those interested the code is availble at <a
            href="https://github.com/mzio/mise-en-scenet">https://github.com/mzio/mise-en-scenet</a>. We can
          still give some indication that our model was able to classify our frames correctly. To determine whether a
          certain frame was directed by someone or another, the model essentially
          learns to represent each frame in a specific manner, where ideally frames shot by the same director end up
          closer to each other or in clusters. As can be seen in the image below, (which is a <a
            href="https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/">T-SNE plot</a> of our representations), this seems to be the
          case! Color is used to denote a director.

        <br>
        <p>
          We now analyze the clip most easily predicted by our model as belonging to the right director for each film.
          Although it is hard to claim that these clips definitively characterize a film or showcase a director's
          exclusive stylistic choices, there are some interesting recognizable connections between what the
          model picks up as iconic and our own understanding through mise-en-scène.

          Here Kore-eda's film depicts the interviews that the recently dead undergo to help re-live their best
          memories. The clip depicts a medium shot with natural low-key lighting and rather dull tones that go along
          with arguably the most recognizable sequence of shots in the entire film. There isn't much to draw the eye,
          signifying some sort of plainness that goes along with many of the interviewee's best memories. However
          because
          everything else in the shot is also so dull, as an audience we can still appreciate their wishes with
          the focus drawn entirely on to the recently dead's recollection.

        <p>
          We're greeted with another easily recognizable clip for Wong's <i>Chungking Express</i>. The rapid camera
          movement depicts a flurry of disordered activity as the cop breaks into a chase. It's unclear what exactly is
          going on here, and plot-wise we have a chase scene that never really gets resolved; the details of the context
          behind this scene are blurry, just like how it is shot. The scene does feel iconic of at least the first half
          of Wong's film: entirely shot a night, slightly seedy, and action without a clear background or resolution.

        <p>
          Here Ang Lee treats us (and the computer) to another action-packed clip that's dominated by a dizzying focus
          on Lo the desert bandit. The medium shot lets us focus in on Lo as he charges forward, but the background is
          an entire horizontal blur. The activity is similar to the previous shot in <i>Chungking Express</i>, but
          elements that might distinguish these scene include a more focused tracking shot that gallops with Lo and a
          more homogenous color scheme that takes in more of the natural surroundings.

        <br>
        <p>
          To me, this clip in Takahata's <i>Grave of the Fireflies</i> was an interesting choice because it seems less
          immediately memorable or representative of the larger film. The camera focuses on Seita in a snug medium wide
          shot that tracks him as he rolls towards an embrace with Setsuko. We can see that they are clearly in a dark
          environment, but there's a clear contrast between Seita starting in the dark and Setsuko clearly illuminated
          by
          some off-screen upper light source. Seita's body accordingly becomes a bit more well-defined as he rolls
          toward
          the light. Light is also present through the sprinkling of fireflies throughout the scene, and in a previous
          scene the siblings' joy at seeing the fireflies suggest that they as a source of light provide some form of
          hope distracting them from their situation.

          The revolving wide shot captures the surrounding larger scenery of the boys, who seem small in the overall
          frame. While certain shots make it seem like we are right with the characters, the revolving angles here
          convey an acute sense of more strongly being a spectactor.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Additional most easily identified clips</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
          Each of these depicted clips denote frames that our model was also able to classify easily from each of the
          remaining films. Just among these examples, we can see unique elements of mise-en-scène that distinguish them
          from each other. <i>New Woman</i> includes copious close-ups that allow the audience to perceive Ruan
          Lingyu's anguished emotions. The steady camerawork that captures the flamboyant musical cutscenes in <i>The
            Hole</i> are also iconic of Tsai Ming-liang's film. <i>Rashomon</i> makes ample use of medium shots facing
          the focused characters head on, and while these types of shots make up the memorable trial scenes, the dual
          between the samurai and the bandit offer this plus additional activity that may help it stand out from other
          front-facing medium shots and close-ups. Finally, it is interesting to see that the narrations in silent films
          like <i>The Goddess</i> are also picked up on by the model. Although perhaps not our intended target clip, the
          stark black with a bit of text does stand out against other video clips.
